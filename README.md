# ChallengeTekna

## Challenge description

This challenge requires me to create an access to a google sheets database, then make manipulations on the columns so we can calculate the average grades of the students.

## Guide to run the code 

This project was developed using python 3 and some of theirs libraries, alogside with some google libraries so that we can acces the google sheet.
Then following theres is a guide to help you run the code.

### Python installation

First we need to make sure that our engine is working, then check if python3 is installed in you computer, run this code on the terminal of your preference(i recommend git bash if you are on windows) :

``` bash
python3 --version
```

It should show somethin like :

```bash
Python 3.x.x
```

If it doesn't show anything like that instal python running the code :

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

Then we need to prepare the enviroment to run our code, then we are gonna use venv to keep a isolate enviroment so our application can run smoothly and wee also need to install the python package manager called pip, so run the code below to run then :

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip
```

Verify if both are correctly installed with these two commands :

```bash
python3 --version
pip --version
```
